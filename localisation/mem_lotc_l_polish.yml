 #EVENTS
 
 mem_lotc.1.name:0 "Trafficking operation"
 mem_lotc.1.desc:0 "After exploring the complex extensively, our science team made an amazing discovery. The data cores appears to be mostly wiped or eroded, but we established that the complex belonged to a civilization unfamiliar to us, that went by name Carcharorion. Apparently, they operated thousands of years ago in this sector of the galaxy. \n\nSomething else, however, is much more unusual. The lower level is densely packed with a large number of stasis pods containing... bodies from our own species. Many of them are still wearing advanced shackles or have crude implants implanted in their nervous systems. It seems these Carcharorion had abducted some of our primitive ancestors and subjected them to experiments, before, for reason unknown, they chose to kill them by cutting the power supply to stasis pods, leaving the prisoners to suffocate. \n\nWe detect elevated radiation levels from the walls and equipment inside the complex. The power core seems to have been either sabotaged or suffered a leak in the past, but we can not be sure. Residue data extracted from the data cores also contained several sets of coordinates."
 mem_lotc.1a:0 "What happened here?"
 
 mem_lotc.2.name:0 "Underwater facility"
 mem_lotc.2.desc:0 "Submerged beneath the water, our science team had uncovered the ruins of a self-contained ecosystem. It appears to have been produced entirely from spaceship components. [Leader.GetName] estimates that several hundred individuals lived here until it was struck by orbital bombardment. Most of the equipment was damaged by salt water but our science team managed to recover fragmented navigational data, which should prove useful. Strangely, both the complex itself and intact projectiles recovered on site used similar designs."
 mem_lotc.2a:0 "A civil war?"
 
 mem_lotc.3.name:0 "[From.GetName] system"
 mem_lotc.3.desc:0 "We are detecting a lonely ship orbiting a gas giant. It seems badly weathered but is clearly still operational. We should approach with caution."
 
 mem_lotc.4.name:0 "The Hub"
 mem_lotc.4.desc:0 "Several Carcharorion vessels seem to be welded together and placed in stable orbit around [FromFrom.GetName]. As our science team made their way in, they found nothing but decay and abandonment. Most of the life support and other vital systems were dismantled, however the team found an isolated holosuite they managed to power briefly with their ship's systems. In doing so, they found themselves on a surface of a strange world, staring at an unfamiliar sky. They managed to record the stars in the sky before the suite burnt out permanently. If accurate, these stars could allow us to narrow down location of the planet recreated."
 mem_lotc.4a:0 "Could it be their homeworld?"
 
 mem_lotc.5.name:0 "The Memorial"
 mem_lotc.5.desc:0 "Unfortunately, we were too late by several centuries. The remains of the complex are still recognizable at the edges of an impact crater, but most of it was obliterated by a meteorite strike. What survived, however, was very interesting. We identified a handful of large rock slabs that were covered by pictograms, possibly of the Carcharorion. A surviving data core [Leader.GetName] found contained references to their home system. With additional data to fill the gaps, it could lead us straight to it."
 mem_lotc.5a:0 "We'll look into it."
 
 mem_lotc.7.name:0 "The ship had been disabled"
 mem_lotc.7.desc:0 "Now that the Carcharorion cruiser is disabled, we should prepare the boarding party to investigate it."
 mem_lotc.7a:0 "Prepare our troops."
 
 mem_lotc.8.name:0 "The ship had been disabled"
 mem_lotc.8.desc:0 "Someone else disabled the Carcharorion cruiser and left it to drift aimlessly. We should prepare a boarding party to investigate it."
 mem_lotc.8a:0 "Prepare our troops."
 
 mem_lotc.9.name:0 "[From.GetName] system"
 mem_lotc.9.desc:0 "We are detecting a disabled Carcharorion ship drifting aimlessly. We should prepare a boarding party to investigate it."
 mem_lotc.9a:0 "Prepare our troops."
 
 mem_lotc.10.name:0 "Boarding successful"
 mem_lotc.10.desc:0 "As our forces boarded the ship, they were greeted with a gruesome sight. The bodies of multiple species, who by all means should be dead, stumbled around, attempting to defend the ship. Some of them were even of our own species! \n\nIt appears, they are still propelled by extensive neural implanting, that kept them going even after death. Fighting all the way through, our boarding party made their way to the ship's bridge. Some data from the flight computers was still usable, and it indicated that the ship's faster-than-light technology had experiencing major problems, similar to those we had eliminated before we even left our home system. \n\nTampering with ship's systems appears to have triggered some kind of self-destruction sequence, causing ship to vaporise moments after our boarding crew returned."
 mem_lotc.10a:0 "Disturbing."
 
 mem_lotc.11.name:0 "The Carcharorion home system"
 mem_lotc.11.desc:0 "With the data we collected, we can identify the presumed home system of the mysterious Carcharorion. We should explore it to discover what happened to them and uncover their connection to our own species."
 mem_lotc.11a:0 "Onward, to answers!"
 
 mem_lotc.12.name:0 "Carchar system"
 mem_lotc.12.desc:0 "We located Carchar - the presumed home system of the Carcharorion. We are not detecting traffic in the system indicative of a spacefaring civilization, so it falls to us to search their planets for answers. \n\nWith the information we already gathered, we have no need to perform a basic survey. However, there are many points of interest we should examine closer."
 mem_lotc.12a:0 "Proceed."
 
 
 mem_lotc.13.name:0 "Gwyliwr"
 mem_lotc.13.desc:0 "Gwyliwr's dense, poisonous atmosphere of greenhouse gases does not look promising to us, but the Carcharorion appear to have had a different opinion. Several large lighter-than-atmosphere vessels are still floating in the upper atmosphere, each appearing to be a habitat for at least a thousand citizens. Several of them were damaged by shots from orbit, but judging by low intensity, those were stray shots. \n\nOur science team found the habitat areas devoid of any personal possessions, and no bodies were recovered, suggesting the population abandoned this place of their own accord."
 mem_lotc.13a:0 "Where did they go?"
 
 mem_lotc.14.name:0 "Crau"
 mem_lotc.14.desc:0 "Traces of battle litter this planet, and large volumes of debris are still adrift in its orbit. It is not entirely clear what  happened here due to the extensive damage sustained by the crafts, but [Leader.GetName]'s projections suggest that several major shipyards were established in the planet's orbit, which used minerals mined from the surface for production. The shipyards were likely valuable military targets, explaining the massive battle over them."
 mem_lotc.14a:0 "Interesting."
 
 mem_lotc.15.name:0 "Aelwyd"
 mem_lotc.15.desc:0 "Two major features are apparent when observing the frozen planet: massive ruined arcologies dotting its surface and even more more massive impact craters. The concentration of the craters over the single largest landmass suggests that they were deliberately dropped on the planet's surface. It seems it has already undergoing the small ice age, with impact winter further solidifying the process. \n\nThe damage to arcologies, meanwhile, extend way beyond ravages of time. Many of them bear massive breaches, with profiles similar to mass-driver rounds. The insides of each structure are filled with dead bodies of species we've identified as the Carcharorion. \n\nOne of the arcologies, however, seems to have been spared direct hits. Multiple corpses are still found there, victims of famine and cold, but they appear to have been deliberately moved and stored at the lower level. It is likely someone moved the bodies there before vacating the arcology."
 mem_lotc.15a:0 "Who could've done it?"
 mem_lotc_terraforming_candidate_tooltip_1:0 "§Y[terraforming_candidate_1.GetName]§! will be able to be terraformed once the £society  §H$tech_climate_restoration$§! technology has been researched."
 
 mem_lotc.16.name:0 "Chwaer"
 mem_lotc.16.desc:0 "The moon's surface appears to house several arcologies and underground tunnels connecting them. Debris from a large number of warships dot the surface of the planet, and structures on the surface appear perforated by powerful weaponry. Carcharorion corpses are found throughout the structures, likely killed by exposure to the vacuum from breached walls, as well as supply shortages. Some even appear to have died from self-inflicted gunshots. \n\nThe science team also found mass graves outside, with bodies simply dumped into trenches and bulldozed over."
 mem_lotc.16a:0 "War never changes."
 
 mem_lotc.17.name:0 "Ofannu"
 mem_lotc.17.desc:0 "Multiple biodomes cover the planet's surface, every one of them is in ruins. Our science team identified trances of  planetary bombardment targeting the population centres. Judging by some surviving equipment found, the locals were working on a major terraforming project when their society was wiped out by hostile force."
 mem_lotc.17a:0 "How did this happen?"
 mem_lotc_terraforming_candidate_tooltip_2:0 "§Y[terraforming_candidate_2.GetName]§! will be able to be terraformed once the £society  §H$tech_climate_restoration$§! technology has been researched."
 
 mem_lotc.18.name:0 "Morthwyl"
 mem_lotc.18.desc:0 "A few ruined radar stations and a small amount of debris are scattered across this moon. It seems to house a naval station, likely to protect its primary facilities. Evidently, it came under an attack but it's impossible to say who won."
 mem_lotc.18a:0 "Interesting."
 
 mem_lotc.19.name:0 "Farchnad"
 mem_lotc.19.desc:0 "The asteroid appears to have been hollowed out and made into a major habitat and a supply hub for an asteroid mining operation. It is also spinning unusually fast, presumably accelerated to artificial produce gravity for its inhabitants. Large number of dead bodies are found inside. \n\nOur science team has managed to recover several digital manifests published across the station, indicating that it was greatly affected by supply line disruption on the onset of war. It seems the undersupplied life support system had finally failed at some point turning the whole asteroid into a mass grave."
 mem_lotc.19a:0 "Interesting."
 
 mem_lotc.21.name:0 "Marchog"
 mem_lotc.21.desc:0 "Several outposts appears to have once been present on this planet, now leaving behind only ruins. They were mining ice and various minerals, presumably to supply the rest of the system. All of them were taken out with precision orbital strikes at some point, leaving behind only ruins."
 mem_lotc.21a:0 "Curious."
 
 mem_lotc.22.name:0 "Caer"
 mem_lotc.22.desc:0 "Our science team located an abandoned complex that appears to have served as a Carcharorion prison at some point. Its cells appears to be mostly empty, suggesting either a mass evacuation of inmates or that the complex was operating under capacity. Another noteworthy element on the surface are the bodies of security forces, many of whom have apparently died of self-inflicted wounds. The lower levels reveal something different - bodies of prisoners outfitted with neural implants of a sort. [Leader.GetName] suggests that those were likely used to control the most dangerous inmates and make them docile."
 mem_lotc.22a:0 "They were experimenting with neural implants? Interesting."
 mem_lotc.22b:0 "This technology is an abomination."
 mem_lotc.22c:0 "Neural implants? We should look into it."
 
 mem_lotc.23.name:0 "Anghenfil"
 mem_lotc.23.desc:0 "A massive battle apparently took place here with countless ships destroyed. Massive clouds of debris are now orbiting the planet drifting aimlessly through the void. [Leader.GetName] reports that he was able to recover several flight computers. They are damaged, but not beyond repair. As we grow more familiar with the Carcharorion, data can be extracted from them."
 mem_lotc.23a:0 "What were they fighting for?"
 
 mem_lotc.24.name:0 "Dolennu"
 mem_lotc.24.desc:0 "Our science team had found a research complex hidden on the moon's surface. It is mostly intact but appears to be scraped of most valuables, including the data cores. However, some data cores were recovered and they are noted for having two distinct sets of entries on them. The first contain references to a proof of alien activity in the system and some interesting research data. It mostly pertains to faster-than-light technology, but is crude and at times, almost deliberately wrong. \n\nThe second set appears to have been created by a strike team sent to secure the results of the previous author's studies. After gaining control of the facility, they note sudden loss of contact with their command. [Leader.GetName] found the body of the strike team in the base's mess hall, apparently dead by self-inflicted wounds."
 mem_lotc.24a:0 "What were they studying?"
 
 mem_lotc.25.name:0 "Erlid"
 mem_lotc.25.desc:0 "Our science team came across a hidden facility. Its personnel appears to have been massacred and its systems wiped.  However, [Leader.GetName] managed to track down several hidden caches. Those contain mostly anti-homeworld propaganda aimed at miners on the outskirts of the system, as well as some tactical data that allow us some insight into Carcharorion fleet operations."
 mem_lotc.25a:0 "What were they trying to achieve?"
 
 mem_lotc.26.name:0 "Furiau"
 mem_lotc.26.desc:0 "Positioned in orbit of the planet, our team found a shipyard, with an unfinished ship still in its clamps. The stasis technology aboard the ship as well as some other elements allows to identify it as a colony ship, however some major oddities in its design are apparent. Designed to operate in space for years without any supply and lacking any faster-than-light technology, it appears designed to travel at sublight speed. \n\nStasis pods show traces of freezing and defreezing but no bodies, as if they were already occupied before those inside were extracted."
 mem_lotc.26a:0 "Were they really trying to get around at sublight speed?"
 
 mem_lotc.27.name:0 "Some secrets are better kept buried"
 mem_lotc.27.desc:0 "Several fleets are entering the system from parts unknown. They do not respond to our hailing, but their movement reveal hostile intentions. The only signal coming from the ships is a simple message in Carcharorion language, repeated over and over again: "Some secrets are better left buried"."
 mem_lotc.27a:0 "We'll see about that."
 
 mem_lotc.28.name:0 "Fate of the Carcharorion"
 mem_lotc.28.desc:0 "Even though our understanding of Carcharorion is still limited, in our study of their home system we collected enough data to identify a system they might have been considering for establishing their colony. Perhaps there we could find answers."
 mem_lotc.28a:0 "Onward!"
 
 mem_lotc.30.name:0 "Unigedd system"
 mem_lotc.30.desc:0 "We successfully followed the trail of clues to reach the Unigedd system, where the Carcharorion survivors were heading from their home system. \n\nWe are detecting large fleet in orbit of a local gas giant, bearing Carcharorion markings."
 
 mem_lotc.31.name:0 "Unigedd system"
 mem_lotc.31.desc:0 "We successfully followed the trail of clues to reach the Unigedd system, where the Carcharorion survivors were heading away from their home system. \n\nWe are detecting a faint signal originating from the gas giant in the system, as if someone is trying to contact us."
 mem_lotc.31a:0 "Prepare for contact."
 
 mem_lotc.33.name:0 "The last of the Carcharorion"
 mem_lotc.33.desc:0 "A faint signal is originating from the gas giant in the system. It went active right after the defenders of the system were destroyed, as if someone is seeking to meet those who did it."
 
 mem_lotc.34.name:0 "Contact established"
 mem_lotc.34.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] is reporting that signal originating from the gas giant has been successfully decyphered. A currently unknown ship hidden within the gas giant is hailing us."
 
 mem_lotc.35.desc:0 " Hello, stranger. You have made quite a journey to this place. I am Bradwyr. The last of the Carcharorion."
 mem_lotc.35a:0 "So, what happens next?"
 mem_lotc.35a.response:0 "I don't know. I'm old. I've survived thousands times longer than I had any right to. My stasis pod has prolonged my life, but even it has its limits. I'm bringing my ship up. I want you to have it. Though I know very little about your species, I can see that you are destined for greatness. In the end, I want the Carcharorion to be remembered for something. Many times I have improved my ship. It was the flagship of my forces. Use it to make a difference."
 mem_lotc.35b:0 "What happened to your people?"
 mem_lotc.35b.response:0 "We were once a civilization, not unlike your own. We looked at the sky and dreamt of finding our place there. However, we were unlucky. It seems trivial now, but we weren't able to overcome the light barrier. We could never make the necessary discoveries, it seems. \n\nConfined to our home system, we were forced to expand in ways others would not. We had aspired to colonize barren worlds. To change them to suit our needs. But we didn't have enough resources. Some even tried to build a spaceship capable of surviving hundreds of years long journey in search for a new home. \n\nAs our civilization grew, so did its needs. Shortages led to war. Our homeworld against the rebellious colonies. The rebellion was quelled, but everything they built - destroyed. As a final act of defiance, rebel survivors launched several asteroids at the homeworld. With our planetary defences crippled, they couldn't stop it. This war claimed 99% of our population. \n\nBut it wasn't the end. Shortly before the war, fortune smiled on us. It seems our system was visited by some alien species, though we didn't get to meet them. One of their ships crashed, leaving remains for us to find. This was a way out of the system for survivors. \n\nWe didn't meet any advanced civilizations in our time, but we found plenty of primitives, including your own species, I believe. However, we lost our way. Many become driven by nothing but will to survive. We experimented with neural implants, and tried to rewrite others' minds to house us: our memory, personality, culture. If we could, we would take over a planet, covertly, and rebuild our society in new bodies. But we failed."
 mem_lotc.35c:0 "Who are you?"
 mem_lotc.35c.response:0 "As I said, my name is Bradwyr. I was the chief scientist in the project to study the alien vessel. When we recognized this vessel as a way to save our species, we knew that it couldn't be allowed to fall in the hand of our government or the rebels. We sabotaged our work and hid. We continued to work in secret, allowing a select few to become our benefactors. In the end, we had a powerful ship with faster-than-light capabilities and the blueprints to make more. \n\nWhen the war came, I led the rescue effort. We saved only a few thousands. We sought to rebuild our civilization, but in doing so we once again split. I believed that we should never repeat the same mistakes as the rest of the Carcharorion. We would make it our duty to protect the galaxy. My opponents disagreed. They were driven to survive at any cost. We became divided once again and fought among ourselves. My side lost. \n\nIn my last attack, I  led what remained of our forces into battle. Once it became clear that we had lost I had dove into this gas giant. They thought I'd crashed my ship, but I merely hid."
 mem_lotc.35d:0 "The last? I'm sorry we killed the rest."
 mem_lotc.35d.response:0 "Don't flatter yourself. The Carcharorion were dead long before you reached out to the stars. What you fought were merely husks. Mutilated corpses driven by crude neural implants. Fading digital echoes. Only ghosts of the past."
 
 mem_lotc.36.name:0 "Legacy of the Carcharorion"
 mem_lotc.36.desc:0 "A massive ship has emerged from the surface of the gas giant. We are not picking up any life signs from inside. It seems the ship is our to take."
 mem_lotc.36a:0 "This ship will serve us well."
 mem_lotc.36a.phile:0 "Carcharorion will not be forgotten."
 mem_lotc.36a.phobe:0 "Their species had failed test of time."
