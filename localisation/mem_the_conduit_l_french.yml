 mem_the_conduit.300:0 "Space Odyssey"
 mem_the_conduit.300.desc:0 "Our sensors have picked up something most unusual, even by our standards. The [From.GetName] system appears to have four large "obelisk" type structures centered around the local star that looks most intruiging. We can't discern any energy signals from the objects, but the shielded world in the system might have some answers."
 mem_the_conduit.300.a:0 "This system merits our attention."

 mem_the_conduit.301:0 "Fruits of Knowledge"
 mem_the_conduit.301.desc:0 "Commander, we believe we have discovered a way to interface with the orbital structures in the [Root.System.GetName] system. Our Scientists reckon we can alter the devices found on [Root.GetName] in a way that will allow us to directly interface. It would provide an excellent opportunity to investigate this technology and who knows what rewards we could discover."
 mem_the_conduit.301.a:0 "Give the order, interface with the device."
 mem_the_conduit.301.b:0 "What usually happens when we mess with ancient devices?"

 mem_the_conduit.302:0 "Fruits of Knowledge"
 mem_the_conduit.302.desc:0 "Our preliminary testing and experimentation has proved very lucrative altogether! A slight increase in power would enable us to exponentially increase output, our scientists assure us the risks are minimal as fully powering the second interface would be a gargantuan task."
 mem_the_conduit.302.a:0 "Sounds good, you can have your resources."
 mem_the_conduit.302.b:0 "Be happy with what you have, no further interfacing."

 mem_the_conduit.303:0 "Fruits of Knowledge"
 mem_the_conduit.303.desc:0 "The effects have been.. remarkable as I'm sure you have experienced. By increasing power to the obelisks on [Root.GetName] we can create a subspace link to our other worlds. We still believe we're at roughly 50% from being fully operational, the potential these objects must hold is staggering."
 mem_the_conduit.303.a:0 "Do it but remain vigilant, make sure we can shut the signal down."
 mem_the_conduit.303.b:0 "No, this project will remain isolated."

 mem_the_conduit.304:0 "Fruits of Knowledge"
 mem_the_conduit.304.desc:0 "Rumors have spread that our population on [Root.GetName] have begun worshipping the ruins, they believe the obelisks are here to usher in a new era of prosperity and our security forces are reporting an increasingly volatile situation. They are demanding to fully power the obelisks."
 mem_the_conduit.304.a:0 "And they are right to do so. 100% power."

 mem_the_conduit.312:0 "The Conduit"
 mem_the_conduit.312.desc:0 "Final orbital structure is online, the obelisks have been fully powered. It is taking all our resources to keep a track of our system. We believe we are up to the challenge and so far our fail-safe protocols are working."

 mem_the_conduit.319.desc:0 "With the defeat of the alien command vessel, the otherworldy incursion has been stopped, and the obelisks shut down for good. The population is demoralized and dismayed, many driven to insanity by the presence of the invaders, with several splinter groups still under the aliens lingering influence. It will take time and care to restore the peoples morale. Yet many questions remain unanswered, just what was the purpose of this invasion?"

 mem_the_conduit.321.desc:0 "The object we salvaged seems to belong to the alien civilization previously encountered in this system. It seems to resemble a core component of an advanced weapon platform. Based on our previous experience with this type of technology, we should take great precautions before attempting to integrate this into the fleet."
 mem_the_conduit.321.a:0 "It looks harmless enough."

 mem_the_conduit.326.b:0 "We have no need for this."

 mem_the_conduit.327:0 "Law of Talion"
 mem_the_conduit.327.desc:0 "Our scientists believe they have devised a way to counteract the defenses that proved impenetrable for our forces on our last encounter. We should assemble our forces and engage the enemy immediately."
