 gov_mem_regressors_omnipresent_tyranny:0 "Omnipresent tyranny"
 gov_mem_regressors_omnipresent_tyranny_desc:0 "The seemingly ultimate form of decentralized dictatorship available for a primitive civilization. Population is split in a few totalitatian blocks, each controlled by similar ideology locked in a perpetual warfare. Every aspect of citizen's life is surveyed and scrutinized with swift and brutal retribution against anyone who shows dissent. Any sign of creativity or progress is eliminated, with population conditioned to accept ruling body as infallible. Even history is edited on the spot without any notice or objection from the population."
 
 gov_mem_regressors_rentier_plutocracy:0 "Rentier plutocracy"
 gov_mem_regressors_rentier_plutocracy_desc:0 "This degenerated form of corporate oligarchy saw complete dissolution of civil institutions, rule of law or basic national sovereignity across the globe. Society is effectively divided between a handful of herediary shareholders divorced from any responsibility or meaningful participation beyond living off dividends and impovershed working class incapable of ever rise against circumstancions of their birth. Valuable resources are wasted on conspicious consumption while education, science or any other form of progress is non-existent."
 
 gov_mem_regressors_stagnant_debauchery:0 "Stagnant debauchery"
 gov_mem_regressors_stagnant_debauchery_desc:0 "This society had embraced hedonism and meaningless pleasure-seeking as a way of life. At birth most people are surgically stripped of any capacity for independent thought while what remains is done away with psychological conditioning. They spend their lives partying or performing tasks without understanding their meaning and are incapable of any advancement."

The civilization was given designation of "post-inflection", as it was believed that it has failed to advance at adequate pace and its resource consumption has undermined its ability to ever reach the space age. Originally we believed a natural flaw in the [desc_civ.GetAdj] psychology or a series of poor choices throughout the history is to blame for this predicament, but today observation outpost crew had made a discovery suggesting that it might not be this simple. \n\nIt appears another observation post was orbiting the planet. Despite its advanced age it nevertheless posessed advanced cloaking technology, and until today it successfully evaded our sensors, but it seems that cloacking field had finally collapsed due to its advanced age. Observation outpost crew had already conducted an excursion inside the station. \n\nThe outpost appears to be long abandoned, and most of the equipment is damaged beyond recovery. \n\nHowever, the search had turned up some usable data cores and they do contain records of infiltrations and "memetic planting" conducted on [desc_civ.Capital_Scope.GetName] in the past as well as references to two other outposts operating over planets §Y[first_missing_civ.Capital_Scope.GetName]§! and §Y[second_missing_civ.Capital_Scope.GetName]§!."

 mem_regressors.300.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] reports that they had successfully located and penetrated a hidden base within the asteroid. \n\nInsides are undeniably of the same design as the cloacked outposts, and just as abandoned. It appears that this is where data from outposts was sent and evaluated. From the look of it, the base is at least a thousand years old, containing multiple assesments of primitive civilizations of the bygone era. Some were identified as a threat and scheduled for "correction" while others were dismissed as too primitive and decentralized. It appears that whoever was operating here is responsible for some civilizations' dire state in the present. \n\nThe facility has sustained signficant damage over time, however some equipment is still usable. In fact, the exploration team had found a working communicator still receiving data from [transmitter_star.Solar_System.GetName] system and it seems that a secondary transmitter is hidden within the star's corona itself. The signal is corrupted beyond our ability to fix it, but if we track down the transmitter itself, we could learn more."
