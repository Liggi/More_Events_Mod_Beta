 mem_regressors.201.name:0 "Post-Inflection Mystery"
 mem_regressors.201.desc:0 "We had spent considerable time observing §Y[desc_civ.GetName]§! that populates §Y[desc_civ.Capital_Scope.GetName]§!. The civilization was given designation of "post-inflection", as it was believed that it has failed to advance at adequate pace and its resource consumption has undermined its ability to ever reach the space age. Originally we believed a natural flaw in the [desc_civ.GetAdj] psychology or a series of poor choices throughout the history is to blame for this predicament, but today observation outpost crew had made a discovery suggesting that it might not be this simple. \n\nIt appears another observation post was orbiting the planet. Despite its advanced age it nevertheless posessed advanced cloaking technology, and until today it successfully evaded our sensors, but it seems that cloacking field had finally collapsed due to its advanced age. Observation outpost crew had already conducted an excursion inside the station. \n\nThe outpost appears to be long abandoned, and most of the equipment is damaged beyond recovery. \n\nHowever, the search had turned up some usable data cores and they do contain records of infiltrations and "memetic planting" conducted on [desc_civ.Capital_Scope.GetName] in the past as well as references to two other outposts operating over planets §Y[first_missing_civ.Capital_Scope.GetName]§! and §Y[second_missing_civ.Capital_Scope.GetName]§!."
