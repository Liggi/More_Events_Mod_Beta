Once detained, he identified himself as a member of an organization called §SThe Order of Silence§! tasked to track down and neutralized enemies of §Y[the_fe.GetName]§!. \n\nHe claims that a dangerous terrorist might be hiding within our territory and demands to be released and allowed to pursue his target further.

As much as your unwillingness to cooperate saddens us, we apologize for our action and promise you that we will not send another agent."
 mem_silencer.21.sp:0 "It has come to our attention that you've expelled one of our agents from your territory. §SThe Order of Silence§!'s job to track down and eliminate heretics is vital for defending our faith, however we recognize divine rights of any sovereign nation to police itself. The Order will sieze its actions in your territory, forever."
 mem_silencer.21.mat:0 "It has come to our attention that you've expelled one of our agents from your territory. §SThe Order of Silence§! is assigned a vital task to find and eliminate threats to our national security and it is unfortunate that you would not recognize validity of its cause. However, in recognition of your natural rights to maintain integrity of your borders, we had ordered The Order to stand down."
 
 mem_silencer.22.phile:0 "It has come to our attention that you've expelled one of our agents from your territory. Your motives to do so were understandable, however we can not afford his target slip through. §SThe Order of Silence§! will continue its operations, with or without your consent. Sorry."
 mem_silencer.22.phobe:0 "You think you can just kick out one of our agents and there will be no consequences, [root.GetSpeciesNameInsult]? §SThe Order of Silence§! is not easily stumped. More agents are on their way now to continue the mission, and your defiance will not be forgotten either."
 mem_silencer.22.sp:0 "How dare you interfere with affairs of the true believers? §SThe Order of Silence§! is tasked with protection of our faith from sedition and heresy and you think you can just "expel" one of their agents? The operation will continue as planned, I suggest you don't stand in the way of the next agent of The Order, for your own sake."
 mem_silencer.22.mat:0 "It has come to our attention that you've expelled one of our agents from your territory. §SThe Order of Silence§! was specifically created to cross contested jurisdictions and do whatever it takes to prevent threats to our national security. We will instruct our next agent to work harder on avoiding detection and we advice you to order your security to stand down, for their own sake."
 
 mem_silencer.23.phile:0 "It is a black day for §SThe Order of Silence§! to see one of its members fallen in the life of duty, but each of them is willing to lay down their lives for the noble cause. Can your security forces say the same, [Root.GetRulerTitle]?"
 mem_silencer.23.phobe:0 "Filthy [root.GetSpeciesNameInsult]! How dare you execute one of our agents?! Rest assured, this insult will not be forgotten and if you thought you can deter §SThe Order of Silence§!, I suggest you think again, while you still have necessary organs."
 mem_silencer.23.sp:0 "§SThe Order of Silence§! mourn its warrior that your actions sent to the afterlife. Where one has fallen, many more will rise to carry out his mission. This is not the end."
 mem_silencer.23.mat:0 "If you think that executing one of our operatives will deter §SThe Order of Silence§!, you are dumber than you look. Our resources are vast and agents are ruthless and willing to sacrifice anything and anyone to reach the objective. This isn't the end, this isn't even the beginning of the end, although arguable it is the end of the beginning."
