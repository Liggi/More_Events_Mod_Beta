 #Events
 mem_rubicon.1.name:0 "Rubicon System"
 mem_rubicon.1.desc:0 "We have discovered large number of unfriendly vessels of unusual design, patrolling §Y[From.GetName]§! System that is filled with old battle debris. \n\nGiven provisionary name "§YRubiconids§!", they appear to be primarily concetrated around thick asteroid belt as if they are protecting something."
 mem_rubicon.1.a:0 "We should monitor the situation."

 mem_rubicon_core_category:0 "Concealed Ship"
 mem_rubicon_core_category_desc:0 "A profile of a large inert vessel can be detected deep within the thich debris field."

 mem_rubicon.2.name:0 "Concealed Ship"
 mem_rubicon.2.desc:0 "[Leader.GetName] reports that [Leader.GetSheHe] had confirmed presence of an unknown vessel inside the thickest part of the planetary debris field. \n\nPreliminary observation suggests that it is parked next to a large rock and is for now safe, but due to hazardous environment, it would be impossible to safely maneuver outside."
 mem_rubicon.2.a:0 "We should keep monitoring it."
 mem_rubicon.2.a.tooltip:0 "Adds §S$mem_rubicon_hidden_ship$§! to §Y[From.GetName]§!: \n£engineering  Engineering §G+6§!. \nBuild a §Sresearch station§! over it to find out more."

 mem_rubicon_hidden_ship:0 "Concealed Ship"
 mem_rubicon_hidden_ship_desc:0 "A ship is hidden deep within the thick debris. \n\n§LBuild a §Sresearch station§L over it to find out more.§!"

 mem_rubicon.4.name:0 "Window of Opportunity"
 mem_rubicon.4.desc:0 "After observing §Y[From.GetName]§! for a while our scientists had formulated a plan to navigate the dense debris field and access the hidden ship. \n\nThis will be risky, but preliminary reports suggest highly advanced technology hidden there."
 mem_rubicon.4.a:0 "Make it happen."

 MEM_RUBICON_EXPEDITION:0 "Concealed Ship"
 MEM_RUBICON_EXPEDITION_DESC:0 "A ship is hidden deep within the debris field designated §Y[mem_rubicon_core_planet.GetName]§!. With precise timing and agile navigation, we should be able to reach it."

 mem_rubicon.5.name:0 "The Worldmender"
 mem_rubicon.5.desc:0 "[Leader.GetName] aboard [Root.GetName] reports that [Leader.GetHerHis] team had successfully navigated the dense debris field in §Y[mem_rubicon_core_planet.Solar_System.GetName]§! and boarded the inert ship concealed in the midst of it. \n\nSaid ship is impressively old, with estimates ranging from thousands to hundred of thousands of years and most of equipment and data cores aboard had been lost to age and debris impacts. However, what we managed to gather is still quite fascinating. It appears that the vessel is a warship-terraformer hybrid called Worldmender. Originally carrying a massive crew and large number of passengers, it is currently coserved under supervision of an AI unit, or "Flletmind". \n\n  \n\n \n\nThe whole Worldmender is too damaged to escape, but parts of it might, with our help."
 mem_rubicon.5.a:0 "Save the essential warship modules."
 mem_rubicon.5.a.tooltip:0 "A new powerful ship will be added to our navy, along with an §Sadmiral AI§!. \nAs long as the ship is in our possession, we will enjoy benefits of §Y$mem_rubicon_mender_archives$§!"
 mem_rubicon.5.b:0 "Save the warship modules but wipe out the AI"
 mem_rubicon.5.b.tooltip:0 "A new powerful ship will be added to our navy. \nAs long as the ship is in our possession, we will enjoy benefits of §Y$mem_rubicon_mender_archives$§!"
 mem_rubicon.5.c:0 "Reactivate the terraforming systems."
 mem_rubicon.5.c.tooltip:0 "If we reactivate the system, the ship will be lost to us. It will be used to mend the debris field into an actual planet."
 mem_rubicon.5.c.tooltip.gaia:0 "producing a brand new §GGaia§! world."
 mem_rubicon.5.c.tooltip.regular:0 "producing a §SRegular§! world."
 mem_rubicon.5.c.tooltip.tomb:0 "producing a §LTomb§! world."
 mem_rubicon.5.c.tooltip.barren:0 "producing a §RBarren§! world."
 mem_rubicon.5.d:0 "Access data on ship's creators."
 mem_rubicon.5.d.response:0 "The ship belonged to a civilisation that identified simply as §SMenders§!. The core tenet of their ideology seemed to be sense of "ecological supremacy", that is, they believed the natural ecosystem of their homeworld is superior to any other life. For generations, they had practiced agressive terraforming with wanton disregard for native life, often breaking down entire planet's biospheres and reforging them anew, and, at times, reforging planets themselves using fleets lead by so-called Worldmender ships."
 mem_rubicon.5.e:0 "Find out more on what caused their downfall."
 mem_rubicon.5.e.response:0 "The information on political affiliations of Menders was scarce, but history of their downfall seems clear. \n\nOne of the civilisation that found itself in Mender's terraforming spree's wake had appearently relied on network of hidden heavily automated shipyards, and although their worlds have quickly been transformed into gardens of Menders' design, several such shipyards remained. \n\nA century or so after their masters' extinction, hordes of drones appeared at the borders of overstretched and complacent Mender Empire, overwhelming their fleets with sheer numbers. Menders who once wiped out their creators found themselves at mercy of the drones and soon were forced to retreat to a hidden base. Despite their best efforts, the enemy had followed them and destroyed the reminder of the armada."
 mem_rubicon.5.f:0 "Access final reports."
 mem_rubicon.5.f.response:0 "Here, in the [mem_rubicon_core_planet.Solar_System.GetName] System, The Menders took the last stand against the machines hell-bent on their destruction. Once a site of a promising terraforming project, it had became a place where they have met their end.\n\n As defeat seemed invetibale, the badly damaged flagship dived into the half-formed shell of a planet and remained hidden and operated by its caretaker AI. Unable to pursue, drones kept vigil in the system. In times, it seems, the surviving drones were designated §SRubiconids§! by the galactic explorers, unaware of their true goals."

 mem_rubicon_mender_archives:0 "Menders' Archives"
 mem_rubicon_mender_archives_desc:0 "The Worldmender databases contains immense amount of terraforming know-hows that we are still unable to move off-site. \n§TWe must not lose this ship if we are to keep the benefits.§!"

 mem_trait_rubicon_mender:0 "Mender Mind"
 mem_trait_rubicon_mender_desc:0 "This AI construct was designed to both lead Mender fleet into battle and see it through rebuilding another world in their image. Nowadays it's been repurposed to lead a different fleet."

 mem_rubicon.6.name:0 "Planet Mending Successful"
 mem_rubicon.6.desc:0 "§Y[mem_rubicon_core_planet.GetName]§! had been successfully transformed into a gaia world. \n\nMenders' dream of a promised land lives on, thousands of years after their extinction."

 mem_rubicon.7.name:0 "Planet Mending Complete"
 mem_rubicon.7.desc:0 "It seems that damage sustained by terraforming equipment was too severe to fully relaize its potential, but still §Y[mem_rubicon_core_planet.GetName]§! had been successfully transformed into a habitable world. \n\nMenders' dream of a promised land lives on, even if a bit tarnished, thousands of years after their extinction."
 mem_rubicon.7.a:0 "Could've been better."

 mem_rubicon.8.name:0 "Flawed Planet Mending"
 mem_rubicon.8.desc:0 "It seems that damage sustained by terraforming equipment was too severe. §Y[mem_rubicon_core_planet.GetName]§! had been successfully transformed into a habitable world, but massive radiation leaks kept it from being properly habitable. \n\nMenders' dream of a promised land did not fully realized."
 mem_rubicon.8.a:0 "At least it holds together."

 mem_rubicon.9.name:0 "Planet Mending Failed"
 mem_rubicon.9.desc:0 "It seems that damage sustained by terraforming equipment was too severe. §Y[mem_rubicon_core_planet.GetName]§! have been fused together, but all the systems that were supposed to turn this massive rock livable did not produce the intended results. \n\nMenders' dream of a promised land have utterly failed."
 mem_rubicon.9.a:0 "Most disappointing."

 mem_rubicon_mended_ecosystem:0 "Mender Ecosystem"
 mem_rubicon_mended_ecosystem_desc:0 "The ecosystem here is built from ground-up following blueprints of long-gone "Planetmenders". Everything is in perfect balance."
