 mem_broken_clock.1.desc:0 "The §Y[From.GetName] System§! is a strange place. \n\nOrbiting a long-dead star is a massive ancient ring world. Despite obvious damage sustained by it over the years, very little debris are visible. Other strange sight is a multitude of shrouded bodies, a planet and a several moons covered in impenetrable purple haze. \n\nBut most importantly, the system is affected with bizzare time dilation effects that do not seem to correspond with knowns principles of general relativity and create pockets of distorted time across the system. \n\nBeside affecting our perception of time, they seem harmless. Yet, something is very wrong with this place..."
 mem_broken_clock.1.a:0 "Ominous."

 mem_broken_clock.1001.desc:0 "A bizzare occurence in §Y[From.Solar_System.GetName]§!. [Root.MemBrokenClock1001] mysterious fog shrouding the planets has vanished revealing planets' surfaces. Massive ringworld structure seems to have somehow repaired all the damage sustained. Even the star itself had changed its composition and turned into a bright A-class star, seemingly reversing billions years of aging. \n\nMost strangely, the desolate system now teeming with life, spawling cities and industrial areas cover the ringworld and one of the larger planets, along with two fully developed habitats appearing out of vacuum, guarded by massive fleets. It's as if the system had never spent a day deserted. \n\nThe mysterious newcomers are hailing us."

Our sacred mission is to cleanse the universe of the impure and abominable alien life. \n\nIn a different time treachery of our enemies had left us trapped in a temporal pocket. But ethernity spent among crumbling realities and broken timelines have only strengthen our resolve. \n\nFight us or submit to your fate, it matters not. Your destruction is inevitable."
