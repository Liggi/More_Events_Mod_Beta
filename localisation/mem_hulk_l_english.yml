 mem_hulk.2.name:0 "Experiment proposed"
 mem_hulk.2.desc:0 "Observation outpost personnel stationed over §Y[their_planet.GetName]§! had been abducting and studying primitives below for some time now and found some unusual genetic markers in test subjects. According to them, [them.GetSpeciesName]'s DNA contains massive untapped potential, although it's not at this point clear what this potential is. \n\nThey have now proposed a grand scale experiment to test their hypothesis. By introducing a synthetic viral agent into planet's atmosphere, they would be able to bring forth change and gauge the exact implications of their finds."
 mem_hulk.2a:0 "Prepare for the experiment."
 mem_hulk.2b:0 "No, this is a bad idea."
 
 MEM_HULK_EXPERIMENT:0 "The Grand Genetic Experiment"
 MEM_HULK_EXPERIMENT_DESC:0 "By introducing a specially designed viral agent into the atmosphere of [their_planet.GetName] our scientists hope to effect a major change in local primitive population and aquire massive amounts of useful data."
 
 mem_hulk.3.name:0 "The grand genetic experiment"
 mem_hulk.3.desc:0 "The crew of [Root.GetName] had finished dployment of viral agent into the atmosphere of §Y[their_planet.GetName]§!. Virus should not significant signs so natives are expected to be clueless until the effect's become apparent. \n\nIt will take some time until infection spreads and develop, effect can be gauged and scientific data collected."
 mem_hulk.3a:0 "And now we wait..."
 mem_hulk.3a.tooltip:0 "In time, something will happen..."
 
 mem_hulk.51.name:0 "Hulking out"
 mem_hulk.51.desc:0 "As the viral agent effects took hold, native population of §Y[their_planet.GetName]§! had experienced a profound change. \n\nTheir bodies swole as energy balance shifted, leaving higher nervous system starved and unable to perform functions beyond basic instincts, mostly hunger and anger. According to observation post's final report, what is left of [hulkpop.GetSpeciesName] species can no longer be considered sentient, as they have lost higher mental functions and are unlikely to regain them with additional genetic manipulations."
 mem_hulk.51a.phile: "We shouldn't have done it."
 mem_hulk.51a.phobe:0 "Sentience was wasted on them anyway."
 mem_hulk.51a.tooltip:0 "[hulkpop.GetSpeciesName] had reverted to pre-sentient state, from which they can be uplifted."
 
 mem_trait_hulks:0 "Hulks"
 mem_trait_hulks_desc:0 "This species once developed sentience on their own, but lost it in a freak genetic mishap that turned them into raging beasts."
