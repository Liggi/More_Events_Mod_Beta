 mem_artifact.52.desc:0 "Our away team entered the station, the place is desolate and appears to have been long since abandoned. The structure is made up of small enclosed rooms with corridors of varying heights, which is hampering progress.\n\nWe eventually managed to restore power to some minor systems in what we suspect to be a control room and have unearthed several pieces of information about this solar system and the research conducted here. The most important being a central object in the system and three research facilities in the nearby vicinity containing similiar artifacts.\n\nAcquiring these three "ciphers" as they are called should be our priority if we plan to further study the main object. On the other hand some of our scientists suggested to not waste time with such a paper chase and try our luck with the main object immediately."
 mem_artifact.52.a:0 "These "ciphers" seem to be there for a reason. Find them."
 mem_artifact.52.b:0 "They are right. Let's not waste any more time."
 
 mem_artifact.53:0 "Shroudborn"
 mem_artifact.53.desc:0 "Unlike anything we have seen before this strange object silently floats amidst the nebula. Only faint energy emmisions are readable. Our scientists are ready to begin the prepared activation procedure. But yet again there is discord amongst their ranks.\n\nWhile some of them are eager to start at a moments notice others still remain reluctant, reminding that we are dealing with unknown and ancient technology.\n\nMaybe we should try to acquire these "ciphers" first before blindly rushing into whatever dark secrets this relic might hold."
 mem_artifact.53.a:0 "On second thought maybe we should search these things first."
 mem_artifact.53.b:0 "Just do it! We have already wasted enough time."

 mem_artifact.63.name:0 "Cloudbuster"

 mem_artifact.63.2.desc:0 "After bringing the ciphers to their intended coordinates as described in the information we got from the abandoned station orbiting Gandvik they seem to have deactivated a formerly hidden defensive mechanism.\n\nNow that our path is clear we should begin to examine the main artifact itself."
 mem_artifact.63.1.a:0 "Let's finish what we have begun."
 mem_artifact.63.2.a:0 "Make it so."
 
 mem_artifact.64.name:0 "The Relic"
 mem_artifact.64.desc:0 "Our Science team has finished their study of the artifact. From all the data available to us we now assume it is not native to our known universe. The technology is different from anything we have seen before. The material it is made of is in a state of constant flux since we powered it up.\n\nOur scientists came to the conclusion that this object is some form of explosive device. According to their estimations, it could obliterate an entire star cluster or even more. If they are correct, we may have found the most dangerous weapon our galaxy has ever seen."
 mem_artifact.64.a:0 "Good to know, it is in our hands."

 mem_artifact.65.name:0 "The Lament"
 mem_artifact.65.desc:0 "When the activation sequence drew near completion a sudden flash brought everything to a halt. All vessels in the system have been moved to the relic whose energy output had went out of the measurable range before becoming inactive again.\n\nOnly moments later three objects formed at the edge of the storm's eye. According to our sensors their energy level is rising rapidly. We must have activated some kind of defensive mechanism."
 mem_artifact.65.a:0 "It's a trap!"

 mem_artifact.100.name:0 "Research Facility Alpha"

 mem_artifact.200.name:0 "Aetheric Biology"
 mem_artifact.200.desc:0 "After observing the relic for the past few years and reading the research data on the station our scientists have made a breakthrough. The technology we have before us is less technical in nature than biological. All data leads to the assumption of these artifacts being alive, atleast to some degree. The spherical objects inside each artifact seem to contain living energy. While being different to any other form of life we have yet encountered they seemingly try to leave the spheres without success. Further study has revealed them to be the involuntary sources of energy for these artifacts."
