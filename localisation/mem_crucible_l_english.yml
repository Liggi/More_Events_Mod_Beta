 mem_crucible.3.name:0 "Gripped by Insanity"
 mem_crucible.3.desc:0 "The population of [From.GetName] appears to have been affected by some kind of collective insanity. \n\nReports from observation outpost indicate rioting on the streets and chanting of nonsensical mantras. Small fraction of natives who maintained their cognitive abilities are fleeing population centers, and their numbers are rapidly dwindling. The [From.Owner.GetName] is on a brink of complete collapse."

 mem_crucible.5.a:0 "How very odd."

 mem_crucible.6.name:0 "Shrouding"
 mem_crucible.6.desc:0 "Our observation post over [From.GetName] reports that they have lost all contacts with the surface beneath due to bizzare fog that suddenly enfulged the planet. \n\nIt's as if planet reacted to our presense adversely."

 mem_crucible.100.name:0 "The Mystery of Crucible"
 mem_crucible.100.desc:0 "We have observed the same pattern repeat on [From.GetName]. \n\nA civilisation rises, and abnormally rapidly advanced through the stages, only to collapse into madness and get enfulged in a strange purple fog. \n\nThe fog parts, revealing population that regressed into stone age, and pattern begins anew. It's as if some mysterious force is guiding this process towards an uncertain goal."

The surveyors had intercepted some kind of sygnal exchange back and forth, although it's too early to say what is being transmitted and for what purpose."

 mem_crucible.102.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] crew was not able to study the surface of [mem_crucible_controller_planet.GetName] in great details, however they still managed to see more than was possible before. \n\nSome kind of activity is definitely happening down there and immense amount of energy is being stored down there.

 mem_crucible.200.desc:0 "Now that we managed to both intercept strange transmissions between [mem_crucible_planet.GetName] and [mem_crucible_controller_planet.GetName] and rougly map out the latter's surface, we are coming close to uncovering true nature of the entire [mem_crucible_planet.Solar_System.GetName] system. \n\nWe can without a doubt tell that some kind of entity has orchestrated an endless loop of death and rebirth, though we can't yet tell what purpose could it possibly sort. Still, whoever control this weilds immense power, and now, after partially mapping out shrouded surface of the planet and decoding of signal exchange is underway, we can finally crack this mystery."
 mem_crucible.200.a:0 "Excellent, let us proceed."
 mem_crucible.200.b:0 "We've gone too far. Some secrets are better left alone."

 mem_crucible.201.name:0 "The Crucible Controller"
 mem_crucible.201.desc:0 "[Leader.GetName] crew reports that [Leader.GetSheHe] have been able to modify sensor array of [Root.GetName] to penetrate the mysterious shroud and find out the reason behind strange occurences in [mem_crucible_controller_planet.Solar_System.GetName]. \n\nDeep within the fog of [mem_crucible_controller_planet.GetName] lies an ancient and powerful machine called "§YController§!". It's been tasked with solving a task - to prevent a being called §SVoldareen§! from escaping its moon. However, within parameters given to the system, the task is unsolvable. All Controller could do is to create mortal shells to house pieces of Voldareen, trapped in a strange cycle of maturing, only to snuff its progress once it gets too close to escaping. On its own the cycle will never end until Controller completely breaks down."
 mem_crucible.201.a:0 "Shut Controller down."

 mem_crucible.301.a:0 "We must prepare to the fight."

 mem_crucible.302.xenophile:0 "May I ask you something? \n\nDo you always just break down someone else's projects without any consideration?

 mem_crucible.302.xenophobe:0 "Worthless [Root.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult]! \n\nDo you have any idea what you've done? Did you have any idea what were you going to do? \n\nYour idiotic meddling had put the entire galaxy in danger!"

 mem_crucible.310.name:0 "Voldareen Solution"
 mem_crucible.310.desc:0 "Though the crew of [Root.GetName] were not able to truly "solve" the Voldareen problem, they had managed to break the rebirth loop. \n\nThe dense fog has fully enfulged [mem_crucible_planet.GetName], forever cutting the planet from our reality. Without need for it, Controller had lowered its defences, removing dense shroud over [mem_crucible_controller_planet.GetName], and shut down leaving the planet and its strange technology for us to claim."

 mem_crucible.320.name:0 "Voldareen Solution"
 mem_crucible.320.desc:0 "Using our understanding of psionics, [Leader.GetName] was able to formulate an alternative solution for Voldareen problem. \n\nThe malignant psi-entity had been effective neutralized, with constructed Voldareen shells gaining true freedom. \n\nFinally fulfilling its purpose, Controller had lowered its defences, leaving both [mem_crucible_planet.GetName] and [mem_crucible_controller_planet.GetName] to our discretion."

 #Chain and projects

 MEM_CRUCIBLE_CHANGE_THE_PROBLEM_DESC:0 "The Crucible Controller can't solve the problem within the parameters it is given. \n\nBut with our own understanding of psionic forces, we can give it a solution."
