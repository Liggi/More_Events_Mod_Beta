 mem_maze.2.name:0 "Amazing discovery"
 mem_maze.2.desc.m:0 "Demolition of the large mountain range on §Y[Root.GetName]§! had opened the way to a valley we were not aware of before. Inside it, landscape engineers had found an alien structure of a sort. \n\nImpervious to scans, it appears to be highly advanced in technology, yet primitive in form and material choice. The walls are intricately decorated in abstract shapes and images of grotesque scenes."
 mem_maze.2.desc.j:0 "When clearing the dense jungles on §Y[Root.GetName]§! landscape engineers had made an astounding discovery. Previously camouflaged with plant overgrowth, an alien structure revealed itself. \n\nImpervious to scans, it appears to be highly advanced in technology, yet primitive in form and material choice. The walls are intricately decorated in abstract shapes and images of grotesque scenes."
 mem_maze.2.desc.q:0 "Minor retraction in quicksand basin on §Y[Root.GetName]§! during stabilization operation led to an astounding discovery. An alien structure of a sort resurfaced, previously buried in sand. \n\nImpervious to scans, it appears to be highly advanced in technology, yet primitive in form and material choice. The walls are intricately decorated in abstract shapes and images of grotesque scenes."
 mem_maze.2.desc.g:0 "Vaporization of a glacier on §Y[Root.GetName]§! had led to an astounding discovery. Previously entirely encased in ice, an alien structure revealed itself. \n\nImpervious to scans, it appears to be highly advanced in technology, yet primitive in form and material choice. The walls are intricately decorated in abstract shapes and images of grotesque scenes."
 mem_maze.2.desc.k:0 "Clearing out the kelp coverage on §Y[Root.GetName]§! had produced something astounding. Once covered in kelp and mistaken for a small island, an alien structure revealed itself. \n\nImpervious to scans, it appears to be highly advanced in technology, yet primitive in form and material choice. The walls are intricately decorated in abstract shapes and images of grotesque scenes."
 
 mem_maze.4.name:0 "Alien structure"
 mem_maze.4.desc:0 "A mysterious alien structure on §Y[Root.GetName]§! was in sight of scientists and laymen spectators alike. Speculations flew wildly over the years, however nobody could suggest a coherent theory of the structure's origin. \n\nRecently, however, a fairly coherent theory suggesting the exterior of the pyramid is a giant puzzle lock had been formulated. Should we authorize an attempt to unseal it?"
 mem_maze.4a:0 "Yes, get everything we need ready."
 mem_maze.4b:0 "We should not mess recklessly with alien artefacts."
 mem_maze.4b.tooltip:0 "We will do nothing with this structure."
 mem_maze.4c:0 "We should treat it as a divine artefact."
 mem_maze.4c.tooltip:0 "£unity Unity output from the structure will increase, but nothing more interesting would happen."
 
 mem_maze.5.name:0 "Alien maze"
 mem_maze.5.desc:0 "Several attempts to navigate images and patterns engraved on the surface of the mysterious structure had finally got results. Touching them in the right order caused a slab, previously sealed shut into the outer wall to move, revealing a way inside. \n\nThe interior of the structure appears to be an endless maze of corridors, twisting and going underground. We do not detect any energy, but the walls are glowing softly, providing a way to see."
 mem_maze.5a:0 "We need to explore it further."
 
 mem_maze.6.name:0 "Results of the first expedition"
 mem_maze.6.desc:0 "As the science team led by §Y[officer.GetName]§! descended into the maze, we had lost contact with them. We waited a long time in hopes for their return with good news, however the wait took longer than expected. Finally, one of the team members had emerged from the depths of the maze, half-mad and exhausted. \n\nHe revealed that as they navigated the maze, §Y[officer.GetName]§! had accidentally triggered a trip wire that caused a giant boulder to roll through the corridor and squash all them except for the sole survivor."
 mem_maze.6a:0 "We will try again, taking rolling boulders into account."
 mem_maze.6b:0 "This is unacceptable risk, seal the maze."
 
 mem_maze.7.name:0 "Results of the second expedition"
 mem_maze.7.desc:0 "The second team, led by §Y[officer.GetName]§! and armed with advanced knowledge of rolling boulders and portable barricades to stop them, Like before we lost contact with them as they descended into the maze. We waited fruitlessly for some time, until several survivors emerged from the maze. \n\nThey told that despite their success at avoiding the traps, they were thwarted by some kind of puzzle guarding a door. It involves rearranging colourful beads fixed on the wireframe of a hypercube in order to somehow remove them through use of extra dimensions. When §Y[officer.GetName]§! was not able to do it, most of the team was melted by some sort of radiation. Sketches carried by survivors should make it possible to figure the solution in advance."
 mem_maze.7a:0 "We will try again, and bring our finished homework."
 
 mem_maze.8.name:0 "Results of the third expedition"
 mem_maze.8.desc:0 "With access to our advanced computation machines, we were able to provide §Y[officer.GetName]§! with a solution method for the puzzle. Once again we have lost contact as they departed and once again we waited for their return. Eventually a single survivor emerged from the maze, with a new tale of failure. \n\nThis time the team had evaded the boulders and successfully solved the hypercube puzzle. However as they advanced further they found themselves in a room with several slabs covered in riddles. Some were trivial to crack, but others were not, and as the team discovered, the mistakes were fatal. After the entire team was electrocuted by lightning bolts from the slabs, the last survivor have chosen to retreat and bring back the news, along with the transcript of all riddles."
 mem_maze.8a:0 "We have gone too far. The riddles won't stop us."
 
 mem_maze.9.name:0 "Results of the fourth expedition"
 mem_maze.9.desc:0 "A committee composed of our empire's most brilliant scientists, philosophers, folklorists and tabletop gamers had provided §Y[officer.GetName]§! and his team with a list of what they believed to be solutions to the riddles in the maze. As the team departed we once again had to wait in uncertainty for them to return. Eventually, several survivors have returned from the maze, again, with bad news. \n\nDespite solving riddle slabs with minimal casualties the team was stopped by a complex mechanical puzzle that required use of elaborate mechanisms and weights composed with exotic matter to produce a safe passage through the room without floor, suspended over an abyss. In [officer.GetHerHis] attempt to solve the puzzle, §Y[officer.GetName]§! had somehow rotated the room around the horizontal axis, fatally smashing most of the team into the ceiling. \n\nThe survivors were carrying a detailed scheme of the room, which should allow us to try out solutions inside a virtual simulation first."
 mem_maze.9a:0 "We are almost there. We can't stop now."
 
 mem_maze.10.name:0 "Results of the fifth expedition"
 mem_maze.10.desc:0 "We had ran extensive simulation before sending §Y[officer.GetName]§!'s team on the mission. As they departed, we patiently waited for the news. Suddenly, the radio silence was broken. It appears §Y[officer.GetName]§! had made it to the centre of the maze! \n\n[officer.GetSheHeCaps] described a large hall, with a brightly glowing green orb seated on the pedestal in the middle. According to the scientist, it's nothing like [officer.GetSheHe] seen before and somehow... alive? \n\nSuddenly, the signal was interrupted. We are now receiving another signal originating from the same area!"
 
 mem_maze.11.desc:0 "We welcome you, wanderers. You have found us and in it, proven your worth and determination. You are worthy of our audience. Worthy of our knowledge. \n\nBut first tell us, what is the greatest virtue for you?"

 mem_maze.13.name:0 "Scientists return"
 mem_maze.13.desc:0 "§Y[maze_leader.GetName]§!'s team had emerged triumphant from the maze. They have troubles recollecting what really happened, but have a spark of madness in their eyes. They demanded immediate access to the datapads, paper, stick and a patch of dirt, anything. After spending many hours drawing and writing, they appear to have returned to normal. Their works, meanwhile, appear to contain several of the answers many of our people were looking for from the dawn of time!"
 mem_maze.13a:0 "We learned so much."
