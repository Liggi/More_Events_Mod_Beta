 mem_gravekeeper.1:0 "The Graveyard"
 mem_gravekeeper.1.desc:0 "Upon entering the [From.GetName] system, our ships are greeted by the sight of several large derelict spaceships. They are surrounded by an ominous "space grave" of thousands of deceased life forms. In the middle of the debris field is what appears to be a space station that looks relatively intact."
 mem_gravekeeper.1.a:0 "What happened here?"
 
 mem_gravekeeper.2:0 "The Gravekeeper"
 mem_gravekeeper.2.desc:0 "The crew of the [Root.GetName] managed to gain access to what appears to be the central mainframe of the orbital installation. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] believes they might be able to breach the station's security protocols, reactivating the facility."
 mem_gravekeeper.2.a:0 "What could possibly go wrong?"
 mem_gravekeeper.2.a.tooltip:0 "Reactivate the space station orbiting [mem_grave_star.GetName]."
 mem_gravekeeper.2.b:0 "Subverting the security of such advanced technology is unwise."
 
 mem_gravekeeper.10:0 "Murphy's Fallacy" 
 mem_gravekeeper.10.desc:0 "The activation was a success! The security protocols have been bypassed, and the facility is fully powered and operational. A permanent crew has been garrisoned on the station. Once they have replaced the disabled security systems with our own protocols and established standard engineering control systems we should have full control over the station." 
 mem_gravekeeper.10.a:0 "This shouldn't take more than a few days."
 
 mem_gravekeeper.11:0 "Murphy's Law" 
 mem_gravekeeper.11.desc:0 "We have lost contact with our scientists in the graveyard system." 
 #mem_gravekeeper.11.a:0 Does not exist -- it is the WORRYING standard response
 
 mem_gravekeeper.21:0 "Awakening"
 mem_gravekeeper.21.desc:0 "After taking a fierce pounding, the alien station in the [mem_grave_system.GetName] system finally loses power and for a brief, joyous moment appears neutralised. The victory is shortlived, as power is restored moments later and the space station quickly reconfigures itself before resuming combat. Clearly there is more here than meets the eye."
 mem_gravekeeper.21.a:0 "This clearly isn't over."
 
 mem_gravekeeper.31:0 "From the Ashes" 
 mem_gravekeeper.31.desc:0 "Our weaponry appears to be ineffective against the target. Given our losses, several strategists suggest dedicating scientific resources to devising a way to penetrate the enemies defenses." 
 mem_gravekeeper.31.a:0 "We aren't so easily beaten." 
 mem_gravekeeper.31.b:0 "Our military has no need for this."
 
 mem_gravekeeper.32:0 "Last Rites" 
 mem_gravekeeper.32.desc:0 "Our scientists believe they have developed military hardware to counteract the defenses that proved unassailable by our forces in our last encounter. Our officers are eager to test their new equipment on the enemy." 
 mem_gravekeeper.32.a:0 "Victory shall be ours!" 
 
 mem_gravekeeper.41:0 "Graverobber"
 mem_gravekeeper.41.desc:0 "We have managed to disable the weapon in the [mem_grave_system.GetName] system. Despite the extensive damage it took from our fleet it appears to still possess the ability to repair. Although it would take an incredible amount of resources, some of our engineers believe that if we act with haste its systems can be modified for use with our own fleets. It would certainly make for a powerful tactical asset."
 mem_gravekeeper.41.a:0 "It will make a powerful addition to the fleet."
 mem_gravekeeper.41.b:0 "This "thing" is far too dangerous. Take it apart before it can repair!"
 
 mem_gravekeeper.50:0 "From the Grave"
 mem_gravekeeper.50.desc:0 "This is a glorious day! Our engineers have finished their work on the weapon we fought in the [mem_grave_system.GetName] system and it has passed all safety tests. While our more cautious engineers hesitate to declare this mysterious technological behemoth to be truly reliable, they agree that it is as safe as any ancient weapon can be. The AI core has been replaced with a new system of our own design, and we are awaiting instruction."
 mem_gravekeeper.50.a:0 "Will we ever know what really happened?"
 
 mem_gravekeeper.60:0 "Dead Rising" 
 mem_gravekeeper.60.desc:0 "Our scientists believe we might be able to unlock the full capabilities of the ancient warship designated as the 'Gravekeeper'. For a price." 
 mem_gravekeeper.60.a:0 "We shall harness its true power, no matter the cost."
 mem_gravekeeper.60.b:0 "It's a waste of resources."
 
 mem_gravekeeper.61:0 "Necropolis"
 mem_gravekeeper.61.desc:0 "Our scientists believe that the ship is now fully operational and ready for deployment; we should be able to use its full capabilities under combat conditions."
 mem_gravekeeper.61.a:0 "Let's see how it holds up."
 
 mem_gravekeeper.70:0 "Ignition"
 mem_gravekeeper.70.desc:0 "-Initiating Combat Protocols-"
 mem_gravekeeper.70.a:0 "Energy output at 120 percent, Assault Mode engaged!"

 MEM_GRAVE_EXPLORE:0 "The Ancient Station"
 MEM_GRAVE_EXPLORE_DESC:0 "Perhaps by tasking a science ship to investigate the derelict orbital station above [mem_grave_star.GetName] we may be able to determine what transpired in that system."
 
 MEM_GRAVE_PC_PROJECT:0 "The Ancient Weapon"
 MEM_GRAVE_PC_PROJECT_DESC:0 "The massive weapon that we fought in the [mem_grave_system.GetName] system is still largely intact and in the process of repairing itself. We may be able to reverse engineer its systems and put it into service with our own fleets."

 MEM_GRAVE_AWAKENING:0 "Dead Rising"
 MEM_GRAVE_AWAKENING_DESC:0 "Unlock the true power of the 'Gravekeeper'."

 MEM_GRAVE_WEAKNESS_PROJECT:0 "Weapon Recalibration - Forlorn Gravekeeper"
