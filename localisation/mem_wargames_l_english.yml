 mem_wargame.2.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] reports the successful investigation of a strange station orbiting [mem_wargate_station_planet.GetName]. \n\nJudging by surviving data cores, the system was set up as a massive experiment or possibly a form of entertainment. \n\nFour species were uplifted by an unknown party, provided with FTL-incapable warships and set up to fight each other, while their benefactors would watch safely hidden on system's outskirts. \n\nThe experiment came to abrupt end when a group of conspirators from all 4 species infiltrated the station and massacred everyone on board. Strangely, no retailation followed, and soon natives, lacking practical knowledge to maintain gifted technology had settled into primitive life."
